## Tools

These tools are needed to assemble the sensor. The
most specialized tool is the crimping tool, which your local
Maker Space / Fab Lab surely has lying around. You may not need to buy each 
of these tools if you can borrow one.

* [Crimping Pliers](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07VX6YGQ8) for JST-XH
  connectors (other brands or types of pliers that are compatible with these 
  connectors will also work, e.g., Engineer PA-09).
* A good, adjustable soldering iron or soldering station with an appropriate 
  solution for venting
* Tweezers, side cutters, wire strippers, M3 hex screwdriver ("Allen wrench")
* Personal protective equipment: safety glasses, possibly gloves, etc.
* ESD protective equipment (not mandatory, but use it if you have it)

## Consumables

Most of these items can be found in any electronics lab, so if you are 
working in a maker space or similar, you can probably get small amounts of 
these without having to buy a big box.

* Good solder, lead free
* Solder wire
* Insulating tape, preferably Kapton tape
* Heat shrink tubing (optional)
* About 25cm thin (0.25&thinsp;mm<sup>2</sup> / 23&thinsp;AWG) stranded wire.
