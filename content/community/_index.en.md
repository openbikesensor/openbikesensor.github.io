Come over to our Discourse forum for discussions with other interested and active community members
on topics like: help and support, local groups, projects, events and further developments.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fab fa-github" title="Develop" url="https://github.com/openbikesensor" url_text="Show repositories" %}}
We publish everything we create as open source. Everything is available on GitHub,
including the software code, schematics, blueprints, CAD models, instructions
and documentation.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa fa-video" title="Exchange" url="#meet" url_text="Join the meeting" %}}
We meet almost weekly to discuss current progress regarding the project and the
software and hardwar development. New members are always welcome here, and it's
a great opportunity to get to know each other.

### Open Video Meeting {#meet}

We directly exchange knowledge and the state of our work in weekly open video
meetings, which are usually held on Mondays. The video call can be accessed
with a link and a code, both of which are posted in an [internal
category](https://forum.openbikesensor.org/t/188) in our forum, to prevent
access and disturbances by bots. You'll need an account there, or ask somebody
who has one, to join.

We're sorry that we have to make it *a little* complicated to partake, and we
want you to know that you are more than welcome to come and listen in, and/or
make your voice heard and join the discussion as a new member of our community.

### Our former Slack workspace {#slack}

The community used to have an open Slack workspace to exchange information.
There are numerous reasons for us to leave Slack and move elsewhere, so we've
decided to close the Slack for new members and move our conversations to [the
forum](https://forum.openbikesensor.org).

In the future we will try out [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) to do direct
exchanges between community members for quick help, ad hoc assistance and short
lived conversations. Once we've found out how we want to do this, we'll post -- of course -- in the forum.

If you want to join our old Slack workspace anyway, e.g. to help us save some
valuable knowledge and edit it into a form that can serve as long-term
documentation, please ask for access in one of the open meetings, we're happy to
let you in to read the archives.
