Starting to build an OpenBikeSensor, there are three models to choose from.

* `HC-SR04P`, featuring the corresponding sensors and the PCB v00.02.
* `JSN-SR04T Vertical`, featuring the JSN-SR04T sensors, the PCB v00.03 and a case that is mounted vertically on the seat post.
* `JSN-SR04T Horizontal`, also featuring the JSN-SR04T sensors, the PCB v00.03, but a case that is mounted horizontally below the seat.
