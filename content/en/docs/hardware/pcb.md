title: Getting a PCB
description: >
  You will need a PCB (printed circuit board) to solder all components to.
  Here's how to get one.

A central part in each sensor build is the PCB (_printed circuit board_). The
difficult part with that is the "printed" -- a PCB is a professionally
manufactured piece of equipment that's hard to build yourself. Here are your options:

* Order the PCB using the prepared design files from a manufacturer. Depending
  on *where*, at *which quality* and *how many boards* you order, this will
  cost a little to a lot of money.
* Find somebody who has ordered your selected PCB already and still has
  duplicates in stock. Ask in Slack for this.
* Build the PCB in a DIY fashion. Since the PCB uses vias and through-hole
  components, this is going to be hard, but if you're properly equipped and
  have done this before, or are not afraid of repeated failure, this might be
  for you.
* Don't use a PCB at all. You can still build a compatible sensor by soldering
  together the components using wires. Beware that we don't provide
  instructions for this though.


## PCB Design Parameters

When choosing your manufacturer, make sure that the following design choices
are supported. Each manufacturer usually provides a list of restrictions that
must not be broken. Our designs use:

* TODO: Via size, minimum trace width, milling path restrictions

## Gerber files

TODO: Where are they?
