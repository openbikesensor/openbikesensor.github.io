# OpenBikeSensor e. V.

<section class="container content">

In December 2021, we jointly founded an association to facilitate our work 
in the future. The association bears the name *OpenBikeSensor e. V.* and is 
registered in Stuttgart's local court's register of associations.

The establishment of an association was discussed and pursued specifically 
to simplify any legal issues. These mainly include the responsibilities for 
our online presence and a certain civil liability. This should not have any 
effect on the community's further development and use of the technology.

Further financial possibilities will open with the anticipated recognition 
as a non-profit organization. In particular, we will examine whether and how 
we can handle collective orders via the association or even sell kits for 
people to make on their own to make it easier for individuals to get sensors.
The association may also be able to apply for or receive subsidies.

### Purpose of the association

The purpose of the association is defined in the articles of association and 
reads:

> The purpose of the association is to prevent accidents in road traffic, 
> promote science and research, and popular education as in ยง 52 paragraph 2 
> No. 1 AO, independently and neutrally with regard to party politics.
>
> The purpose of the statutes is realized in particular through
> * Promotion and implementation of scientific research projects on traffic 
>   safety and traffic infrastructure, especially non-motorized traffic.
> * Promoting the development and dissemination of technologies for the 
>   objective measurement and evaluation of relevant data.
> * Making data and findings available to the public as open data.
> * Networking researchers, public authorities, and stakeholders to promote 
> the usability of collected data.
> * Organizing public meetings and informational and educational events.
> * Public outreach
>

### Membership

All private individuals and legal entities are free to submit an application 
for admission to the new association to the board of directors. Shortly we 
will provide an application form for this purpose on this page. To contact 
the board, you can use the e-mail address from the [About Us]({{< relref
"contact" >}}).

Membership in the association is explicitly **not a prerequisite to 
participating** in the project. The existing community shall remain as it is 
and continue to administer itself -- whoever joins the community or 
contributes, belongs to it -- whoever joins the project gets to decide! This 
means that decisions with no legal or financial implications will take place 
in the usual way.
