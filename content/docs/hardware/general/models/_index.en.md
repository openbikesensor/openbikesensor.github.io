If you want to build an OpenBikeSensor distance meter, you must first choose a model, a version, and a housing variant.

There are many variations for each model due to the project's diversity and the various requirements by other parties. For simplicity, we maintain a "standard" variant here on the website, in the instructions and order lists. This is currently:

* PCB version 00.03.12
* Main case (formerly "Vertical Case")
* Display case (prev. "SlideOnDisplay")
* A bracket according to the respective requirements

Other possible combinations will be described here at some point, and the respective components will also be linked. For now, we want to concentrate on documenting this "standard variant" in detail.
