> This guide assumes that you have a working OpenBikeSensor. [If you don't, start here!]({{< ref "/docs/hardware" >}} "Hardware")

If you get an OpenBikeSensor, there are a few things you should do first.

1. Check if your handlebar fits the OpenBikeSensor's display/button holder. There are basically two different kinds of handlebars: thinner ones with a 25.4mm diameter and thicker ones with a 31.8mm diameter. You might create some kind of adapter if the device is designed for 31.8mm and you have a 25.4mm handlebar, but the other way around is not possible.
2. Measure the distance between the outer edge of the device and the end of your handlebar. Enter these values into the configuration options.
3. Set your privacy zones. You could probably get the GPS location with any digital map app. Enter these values into the configuration options.
4. Check if the SD card is ok and, in the best case, empty.
5. Load the device's battery.
6. Turn on your device and wait until it has found your GPS location. It may take some time for it to find the satellites. The display will exit the status screen as soon as your location is known. While moving, it might take up to 15 minutes until the device knows where you are. Stand still for faster results.
7. Put the sensor on your bike and go for a ride. Please be mindful of traffic, and don't let the OpenBikeSensor distract you!
8. Push the button every time you're passed (no matter if it's a car, truck, bus, or motorbike). To understand how often close passes occur, it's important to confirm every pass, not only the close ones.
9. After your ride, switch off the device. Hold the button on the display while throwing the switch to ensure you don't lose any data. 
10. You can upload your data [to a portal](https://forum.openbikesensor.org/t/uebersicht-verfuegbarer-portale/688) by creating an account, copying the API key from the profile settings into the configuration of the OpenBikeSensor, and pressing "Upload tracks" in configuration mode. You can also hold the button on the display. The device must be connected to a WLAN with internet access for the latter option.
