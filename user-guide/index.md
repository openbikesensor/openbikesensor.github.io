# User Guide

This section helps you *use* your OpenBikeSensor (OBS). Think of it like the
manual that came with the device, only we don't need to print it. No matter
whether you built your sensor yourself, or got a pre-built sensor from someone
else, this guide describes how you can help collect important data with your
fancy new device.
