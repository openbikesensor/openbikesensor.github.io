# Hardware 

This section documents the possible sensor configurations you can build for
yourself, and also provides instructions what you need to purchase and how you
are able to build your own OBS.

Starting out, make sure to check out the [model selection](models) to figure
out which version of the OBS you want to build.

Next up, you will need to figure out all the [parts](parts) that you need to
purchase or create. This includes a lot of electronic components, a PCB, the 3D
printed case and fixtures, wires and fasteners. Check out the detailed BOM for
your version.

We also provide instructions here on printing your own cases, ordering PCBs
from your favorite manufacturer, and for assembly of the sensor from all the
parts.

**Note:** This website is still work-in-progress, and some parts of the
documentation are not complete. If you run into trouble, ask in Slack. Don't
expect a smooth experience just yet -- but we're working on it. However, don't
fear, while not necessarily straightforward at all times, it is still very much
possible for beginners to complete this build and construct their own OBS. 

## Construction kits

Because the OpenBikeSensor consists many parts from many different sources,
bulk orders organized by local groups are advisable. Head over to Slack if you
want to organize or paricipate in a bulk order.
